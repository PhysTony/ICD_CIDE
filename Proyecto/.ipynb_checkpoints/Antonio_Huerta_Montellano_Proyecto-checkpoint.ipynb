    "\n",
    "## Total World GDP: $91.98 Tn\n",
    "\n",
    "World GDP\n",
    "\n",
    "The world GDP is the added total of the gross national income for every country in the world. Gross national income takes a country’s GDP, adds the value of income from imports, and subtracts the value of money from exports. The value of gross national income, GNI, differs from that of GDP because it reflects the impact of domestic and international trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the GNIs of every country in the world are added together, the value of imports and exports are in balance. The world economy consists of 193 economies, with the United States being the largest.\n",
    "\n",
    "As per World Bank estimates, the nominal world GDP in 2017 was $80,683.79 billion. In 2018, the nominal world GDP was $84,835.46 billion in 2018, and it’s projected to be $88,081.13 billion in 2019. In 2018, the growth rate for the world GDP was 3.6%.\n",
    "Nominal GDP vs. PPP GDP\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare GDPs around the world, currencies must be converted so that they’re consistent across all countries. There are two main systems of common currency conversion: nominal and PPP. These two approaches to GDP estimation have separate strengths and are generally used for different reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal GDP is useful for large-scope GDP comparison, either for a country or region or on an international scale. The nominal GDP of an area is determined using up-to-date market prices and shifts according to inflation. By incorporating an area’s inflation rate in the GDP calculation, nominal GDP can indicate when prices rise in an economy. The rate of price increases in an economy is also factored into nominal GDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main downfall of nominal GDP is that it doesn’t account for the living standards in a country - it focuses only on economic growth and performance. Also, generally speaking, nominal GDP can differ significantly from year to year depending on variations in the exchange rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "PPP stands for purchasing power parity. PPP GDP is used to measure both the economic growth and living standards in a country, making it a useful tool in global comparisons. The PPP approach uses exchange rates to convert one country’s currency into the other. Then, using a consistent amount of money, the quantity of goods and services that may be purchased in the countries is compared. For example, PPP may compare the cost of a car in France to the cost of a car in Japan (after using the exchange rate to convert yen to Euros, or vice versa) to analyze the difference in GDP and cost of living between these nations. PPP GDP stays relatively stable from year to year and isn’t significantly impacted by shifts in the exchange rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "PPP GDP can be faulted for the fact that it doesn’t incorporate discrepancies in quality between goods and services in different countries. In general, it’s less exact than nominal GDP and often hinges on estimates rather than calculations. As such, the nominal GDP is typically used to measure and compare the size of national economies.\n",
    "Nominal GDP Rankings by Country\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the largest economies in the world? According to the International Monetary Fund, these are the highest ranking countries in the world in nominal GDP:\n",

    "\n",
    "The Largest Economies in the World\n",
    "\n",
    "The three largest economies in the world as measured by nominal GDP are the United States, China, and Japan. Economic growth and prosperity are impacted by a wide array of factors, namely investment in workforce education, production output (as determined by investment in physical capital), natural resources, and entrepreneurship. The economies of the U.S., China, and Japan all have a unique combination of these factors that have led to economic growth over time, as outlined below.\n",
    "United States\n",
    "\n",
    "The United States has been the world’s largest economy since 1871. The nominal GDP for the United States is $21.44 trillion. The U.S. GDP (PPP) is also $21.44 trillion. Additionally, the United States is ranked second in the world for the approximate value of natural resources. In 2016, the U.S. had an estimated natural resource value of $45 trillion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several factors contribute to the U.S.’s powerful economy. The U.S. is known globally for cultivating a society that supports and encourages entrepreneurship, which encourages innovation and, in turn, leads to economic growth. The growing population in the U.S. has helped diversify the workforce. The U.S. is also one of the leading manufacturing industries in the world, coming only second to China. The U.S. dollar is also the most widely used currency for global transactions.\n",

    "## Median Income by Country 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "Median income is a metric used to identify the midpoint of a given nation’s income distribution. Half of a country’s residents earn an income that is higher than the median, while the other half earn an income that falls below the median. Because median is slightly different from an average, or mean, it is also slightly more insulated against extreme \"outlier\" values that could throw off the accuracy of a statistic. For example, consider the following sample group of people and their incomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mike - $30,000 Ahmed - $40,000 Stephanie - $50,000 Midori - $40,000 Contessa - $25,000 Gary - $55,000 Jordan - $1,000,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to Jordan's unusually high salary, the average, or mean, of all these incomes is $177,142, which is wildly inaccurate for all seven people listed. However, the median (also called \"typical\") income is $40,000, which is fairly accurate for everyone but Jordan.\n",
    "\n",
    "World Bank tracks a number of income- and poverty-related metrics, including GDP per capita, GNI per capita, GINI coefficient per country, and median income. As of March 2021, the 10 countries with the highest median incomes ranked are below. Note that these amounts are in current \"international dollars\", which is a theoretical dollar often used in country-to-country comparisons. International dollars are not equivalent to U.S. dollars, or euros, or any other real-world currency.\n",

    "## Gini Coefficient by Country 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gini coefficient, also called the Gini index or Gini ratio, is the most commonly used measure of income distribution—simply put, the higher the Gini coefficient, the greater the gap between the incomes of a country's richest and poorest people. A country's Gini coefficient is important because it helps identify high levels of income inequality, which can have several undesirable political and economic impacts. These include slower GDP growth, reduced income mobility, greater household debt, political polarization, and higher poverty rates.\n",
    "Explaining the Gini coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "Developed by Italian statistician Corrado Gini in 1912, the Gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, but is often written as a percentage. To offer two hypothetical examples, if a nation were to have absolute income equality, with every person earning the same amount, its Gini score would be 0 (0%). On the other hand, if one person earned all the income in a nation and the rest earned zero, the Gini coefficient would be 1 (100%). Mathematically, the Gini coefficient is defined based on the Lorenz curve. The Lorenz curve plots the percentiles of the population on the graph's horizontal axis according to income or wealth, whichever is being measured. The cumulative income or wealth of the population is plotted on the vertical axis.\n",
    "Limitations of the Gini coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Gini coefficient is a useful tool for analyzing the wealth or income distribution in a country, it does not indicate that country's overall wealth or income. Some of the world's poorest countries, such as the Central African Republic, have some of the highest Gini coefficients (61.3 in this case). A high-income country and a low-income country can have the same Gini coefficients. Additionally, due to limitations such as reliable GDP and income data, the Gini index may overstate income inequality and be inaccurate.\n",
    "Countries with the highest and lowest Gini coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "South Africa ranks as the country with the lowest level of income equality in the world, thanks to a Gini coefficient of 63.0 when last measured in 2014. That said, in 2005, the Gini coefficient was even higher, at 65.0. In South Africa, the richest 10% hold 71% of the wealth, while the poorest 60% hold just 7% of the wealth. Additionally, more than half of South Africa's population lives in poverty.\n",

    "Nordic and Central Eastern European countries dominate this list, claiming seven of the top 10 slots. Inequality is generally lower in Europe than elsewhere in the world, and the Gini coefficient offers quantifiable proof of that fact. The United States has a Gini coefficient of 41.1. In 2015, the top 1% of earners in the United States averaged 40 times more income than the bottom 90%. In the U.S., poverty is a growing issue, where an estimated 12.3-17.8 percent below the poverty level (see Poverty Rate by Country). Many of these low-wage workers live paycheck-to-paycheck and have no sick days, pension, or health insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gini coefficient saw sustained growth during the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1820, the global Gini coefficient was 0.50, and in 1980 and 1992, the figure was 0.657. According to World Bank's Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2020 report, the Gini coefficient increases about 1.5 points in the five years following major epidemics, such as H1N1 (2009), Ebola (2014), and Zika (2016). While the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are still being calculated, early estimates predicted an increase in Gini coefficient of 1.2-1.9 percentage points per year for 2020 and 2021, signaling an increase in income inequality."
